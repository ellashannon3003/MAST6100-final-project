Final Project Overview:

Obesity rates globally have increased with time, with approximately 64% of adults aged 18 years and over in England were estimated to be overweight or living with obesity. Obesity is linked to many other health problems such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.

We want to investigate what lifestyle factors have the largest influence on whether an individual is living with obesity so that we can see whether making changes to routines can reduce a person’s chances of being obese.

Similarly, we want to investigate whether factors such as age, gender and having a family history of obesity increase the chances of being classified as obese. This way, if there is a strong correlation, those at risk of obesity can make the lifestyle changes necessary to try and mitigate this risk.
